# üßë‚Äçüíª OrangeHRM Automation QA Framework
# üìå Project Overview
The OrangeHRM Automation QA Project focuses on automating acceptance and integration testing for the OrangeHRM web application. By leveraging Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber and Test-Driven Development (TDD) with TestNG, the project ensures the reliability, scalability, and seamless functionality of the platform. The automation tests streamline key workflows such as user authentication, employee management, and administrative operations, reducing manual effort and delivering high-quality outcomes.
# üåü Key Features
- **Functional Testing with Selenium WebDriver:**
Automates critical workflows, including user interactions and system validations, to ensure application reliability.

- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):**
Implements Cucumber and Gherkin syntax to create human-readable test scenarios, fostering collaboration among stakeholders.

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
Adopts TDD practices with TestNG for robust unit and integration testing, ensuring a high-quality codebase.

- **Comprehensive Reporting and Logging:**
Generates detailed test reports with Extent Reports and leverages Log4j for effective debugging and monitoring.
# üîß Technologies Used
We utilize the following technologies in our project:
- **Java**: Core programming language utilizing OOP principles.
- **POM (Page Object Model Pattern)**: Organizes web elements and actions for efficient test maintenance.
- **TestNG**: Supports Test-Driven Development (TDD) by structuring test suites and executing tests.
- **Cucumber BDD with Gherkin Syntax**: Implements Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for clear, human-readable tests.
- **Selenium Webdriver**: Automates web browsers for end-to-end testing.
- **Extent Report**: Generates detailed test reports for easy analysis.
- **Log4j**: Creates trace log files for debugging and monitoring.
- **Apache POI**: Handles CSV file operations for data storage and manipulation.
- **Maven**: Manages project dependencies and builds.
